## Project Access 
Starting with version 2.0.2 there are now four project access options. 
* Open and anonymous - anyone with the url for the project can access it, no participant id information is collected
* Open with participant ids - If you send out unique url links Easy HtmlQ will automatically register a user name or code. Use this format: [www.yourdomain.com/?userCode=USERCODE]() &nbsp;&nbsp;In the results file, the name or code given for USERCODE will be listed in the "urlUserCode" column of the results. 
* Restricted and anonymous - only those with the project access code can do the Q sort. The access code is the same for all participants
* Restricted and participant name input required - participants requred to enter the access code and their name before they can start the Q sort.
