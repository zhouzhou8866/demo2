# Analysis and Interpretation of Easy HtmlQ Data

### Step 1 - Export the data from your Realtime Database

### Easy HtmlQ data is in JSON format. To export the data, first go to your Firebase console and click on "Realtime Database" in the Navigation panel on the left. Next, click on the three dots on the right side and then click "Export JSON".

<p>

### Step 2 - Import the data into an analysis software package

### 2a.

### To view and analyze the JSON data you will need to import it into analysis software such as [KADE](https://github.com/shawnbanasick/kade) (version 1.2.1 or later) or the qmethod R package. If you use KADE, the next step is to click "Import", "JSON", and "Load JSON file" as shown in the image below.

<p>

### 2b.

### The file has now loaded into KADE, but you need to select the variable that you want to use as the ID for the participants. In this example I use the random ID assigned by Firebase to the participants' data (the first option, labelled "Id" in the file). If you used Easy HtmlQ version 2.0.2 or later, and depending on your project setup, you might alternatively select "urlUserCode" (if you sent unique urls to all of your participants) or "userInputId" (if you required all participants to input a name or id) as the analysis ID.

<p>

### 2c.

### After selecting the participant ID variable, you can upload a text file with your statements and continue the analysis of the Q sort data in KADE. If you want to examine the other results data, you can click the "Download JSON data as CSV" button and export the rest of the project data from Firebase.

## Interpretation of Easy HtmlQ Data Common to All Projects (Version 2.0.2 and later)


### In the CSV format file, the left-most column will be the participant ID information. In the image below the "Id" column shows the random number IDs generated by Firebase. The second column is the "accessCode" variable. For the Demo project, no access code is required, so there is no data in this column.

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/shawnbanasick/easy-htmlq/raw/master/readme_assets/id-and-accessCode.png" width="300" />
<p>

### If you used user-specific urls, then those identifiers will be listed in the "urlUserCode" column (Easy HtmlQ version 2.0.2 or later). If you required each participant to input their name or id number, then those will be shown in the "userInputId" column (before version 2.0.2 the column was labelled "participantId").

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/shawnbanasick/easy-htmlq/raw/master/readme_assets/userId-inputId.png" width="300" />
<p>

### Another set of columns labelled with the prefix "dur" give the time spent by each participant on the individual steps of the survey. The first column "dur0" gives the total time in seconds for the complete survey. The other columns give the time spent on each step of the survey.

<p>

### A third set of columns indicate the number of cards allocated to the Negative ("nneg"), Neutral ("nneu"), and Positive ("npos") sections in Step 1 of the project.

<p>

### The Q sort data is recorded in two forms. The first is the condensed form, with all of the sort data put into a single cell of the spreadsheet.

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/shawnbanasick/easy-htmlq/raw/master/readme_assets/condensed-sort.png" width="700" />
<p>

### The second form has the Q sort value for each statement in a separate cell of the spreadsheet.

<p align="center">

<p>

<br />
<br />
<br />

## Interpretation of Optional Step 4 Data


### If you have included Step 4 (comments for the highest and lowest ranked cards) in your project, there will be columns that contain the comments for each statement. Each statement gets one column, so depending on how your participants do the Q sorts, there could be many comment columns in your project results CSV file.

<p>

<br />
<br />
<br />

## Interpretation of Optional Step 5 Data


### If you have included Step 5 (post-Q sort questionnaire) the results will be reported together in a set of columns with the prefix "form". Unfortunately, they are confusingly numbered using a [zero-based numbering system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-based_numbering). In other words, it starts by designating the first question with 0, so the results column its label is "form0". For the second question the column label is "form1", and so on.

<p>

### In the demo, the first and second questions (in the results file columns "form0" and "form1") are text input questions, so their interpretation is straightforward. The "form0" is the year of birth, and the column for the second question of the survey labelled "form1" has short text answers about the class.

<p>

### The third question (column labelled "form2") is a "radio" type question while the fourth question (column labelled "form3") is a drop-down "select" type question. These two types of question both use zero-based numbering to report their results.

<p>

### For the demo survey results shown below, the first participant checked the first answer "Freshman" (numbered "0") and selected the third answer "English Literature" (numbered "2") for these two questions. The second participant selected "Junior" and "Global Studies", so in their results these are reported as number "2" and "0". The third participant selected "Sophomore" and "English Literature" in the survey, so their results are "1" and "2".

<p>

### The "form4" results are for a checkbox-type question. Unlike the previous radio- and select-type questions above which forced participants to select a single answer, this question type allows for multiple multiple answers. Answers that are checked are reported as "1", while un-checked answers are reported as "0". In this example, the first participant checked the first two options ("Lecture" and "Group Discussion"), the second participant checked all the options, and the third participant checked only the last option ("Active Learning").

<p>

### The last three questions on the demo survey are the scale questions. Unlike the previous radio- and select-type questions, the scale question results do **NOT** use the zero-based numbering system to report the participant's responses. The scale2- (usually a yes-no binary), scale5 and scale10-type questions just report the number of the selection made by the participant.

<img src="https://github.com/shawnbanasick/easy-htmlq/raw/master/readme_assets/scale10_multiple.png" width="850" />
<p>

### For the example answers from the demo project, the first participant answered "No" to the statement "I have used an iPad in class before." and "Yes" to "I have used a notebook in class before". The second participant answered "No" to both questions, while the third participant answered "Yes" to both statements.

<b>Scale Question Results</b> <br/>
<img src="https://github.com/shawnbanasick/easy-htmlq/raw/master/readme_assets/form5-form6-form7.png" width="300" />
<p>

### In a similar fashion, the scale5 and scale10 question results report the number that was chosen by the participants in a straightforward manner. For example, in "form6", the first participant choose "3" for the question "How would you rate the use of iPads in this class?", and "4" for the question "How would you rate this class overall?".

<br/>

### Finally, for "form7" the first participant answered "5" for the question "How would your rate the use of the Socrative website in this class?", and "2" for the question "How would your rate the use of the Quizlet website for this class?".
